# My Personal Website

Welcome to the repository of my personal website. Here, you can find my blog posts as well as the overall structure of the blog.

It was developed using React, Next.js, and gray-matter.

If you'd like to learn more about how the blog was built, check out the posts where I explain the development process and how it has evolved over time:
